      "**Approximate Savings Metrics:**\n",
      "- **Cost Savings:** Charging during off-peak hours can save you approximately **$0.09 per kWh** compared to peak hours.\n",

By adjusting your thermostat settings and utilizing time-shifting strategies, you can make the most of your heating system.\\n\\n**Top 2–4 Actionable Recommendations**  \\n1. **Lower the Thermostat Overnight**:  \\n   - Set your thermostat to a lower temperature (e.g., 60°F or 15°C) during the night when you're sleeping. This can save energy without sacrificing comfort.\\n\\n2. **Use a Programmable Thermostat**:  \\n   - If you have a programmable thermostat, set it to start heating your home about 30 minutes before you wake up. This way, your home will be warm when you get up, but you won't waste energy heating it all night.\\n\\n3. **Time Your Heating for Peak Comfort**:  \\n   - Schedule your heating to run during the hours you are most active at home (e.g., late morning to early evening). Consider raising the temperature slightly during these hours and lowering it when you’re out or asleep.\\n\\n4. **Consider Zoning**:  \\n   - If you have a multi-zone heating system, adjust the temperature in different areas based on usage. For example, keep living areas warmer while lowering the temperature in unused rooms.\\n\\n**Approximate Savings Metrics**  \\n- Lowering the thermostat by 1°F can save about 1% on your heating bill. If you lower it by 5°F overnight, you could save approximately 5% on your heating costs for that period.\\n\\n**Next Step Instructions**  \\n- Review your current thermostat settings and make adjustments based on the recommendations above.
